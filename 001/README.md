[add_at_head.c](add_at_head.c) - A program that adds a new node at the beginning of a linked list

**Accomplishments:** I read the first 73 pages of the book [Programming Logic and Design Comprehensive - by Joyce Farrell](https://b-ok.africa/book/1211079/f7417c). It is helping me to broaden my view on Programming logic. So far, I have learnt on the importance of using pseudo-coding to solve a problem before getting to actual coding. I am implementing that to my behavior to my coding practices.

**Thoughts:** Being my first official day, I am so excited to start this journey of #100DaysOfCode
