### [Day-3 Tweet]()

Today I learnt more on Pointers, Arrays and Strings.

**Accomplishments:** I got to practice on pseudo coding and logic thinking before coding a solution. It was a nice thing to do, I am going to adapt to that with time. 

**Thoughts:** The days are moving so fast. I just started yesterday an I am already on Day 3. I am looking forward to explore more on the coming days. Tomorrow, I will dive deeper in Pointers, Arrays and Strings in C.
