# Day 36 of #100DaysOfCode
- Today I have solved 1 problem in codewars. I was afraid of the problems there, and the general appearance of the site. I used to think that i am not smart enough to do the katas there...but now that i have started attempting them i will continue to do so!! I am enjoying the ride so much.
- Building code mastery by doing about 3 - 5 katas every day sounds like a great idea, right? Let's do it.
