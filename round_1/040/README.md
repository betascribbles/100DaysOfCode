# Day 40 of #100DaysOfCode

- Today I have completed the last module on Freecodecamp web development course and complted one of the 5 certification projects; [the tribute page](https://codepen.io/betascribbles/pen/mdwXbao?editors=1100).
- I feel accomplished. I started this course on August 2019, but I did not pay much attention to it untill 1st September 2021. I can't believe that I actually did it in a month. When I started out, the modules seemed to be endless...but they actually do end alot faster if you wourk smartly on them.
- I am enjoying this journey, let's keep moving.
