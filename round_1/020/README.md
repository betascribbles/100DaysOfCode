#Day 20 of #100DaysOfCode
It is amazing how days move so fast. I just started the other day and now I am 1/5 done with my 100 days of code journey. The learning is awesome.

Today I learnt about PID (process ID) and PPID (Parent Process ID) which are just identification numbers given to the terminal processes. I made a small program to print to stdout the PID and the PPID of the current working process.
