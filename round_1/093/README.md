# Day 93 of #100DaysOfCode

My Airbnb clone project started yesterday. Today I am rehersing on the concept of OOp in python so that I can make the Airbnb console with the guidelines given in the question procedures.

I am kinda afraid of the project but I believe I am in a position to do it. I just need to have a little more faith in myself.
