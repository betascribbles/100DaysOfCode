[strlen.c](strlen.c) - A program that returns the length of a string entered by the user.
[swap_int.c](swap_int.c) - A program that takes the values of two integers from the user and swaps them.

**Accomplishments:** I read more on arrays, strings, pointers and logic. I also developed several algorithms to provide the length of a string. It feels so nice to find out more than one way to do stuff. I also solved a few questions in Grapper and uploaded my code there. Grapper gave me a few gold coins for that. It feels good to give back to the Grapper community.

**Thoughts:** It is my second day, and I feel so great with my progress. I am looking forward to learn more everyday.
