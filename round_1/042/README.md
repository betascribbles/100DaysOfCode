# Day 42 of #100DaysOfCode
- Days are moving so fast, huh. I'm shocked at the progress that I am making...we're almost half-way our journey. I am grateful to God for this.
- Today, I am doing a Python course from pluralsight -by Sarah Holderness. It is a short course, I am taking it to have a brief idea of what I am expecting to learn ahead. I will be done with it hopefully by tonight b4 I go to bed. Let's see how far I will reach.
-- Latest update!!! I have completed the short Pluralsight python course and worked on the html of my survey form for FCC project. I am doing great so far.
