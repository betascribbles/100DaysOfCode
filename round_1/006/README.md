### Day 6 of #100DaysOfCode

- [strcat.c](./strcat.c) - a program that concatenates 2 strings.

**Accomplishments:** I have learnt to oconcatenate two strings. I also learnt about Recursion, followed along [Neso Academy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JqbrwlvreY&list=PLBlnK6fEyqRggZZgYpPMUxdY1CYkZtARR&index=80) youtube series.

**Thoughts:** For the last 2 days, I have been reading more books than writting code. It really felt that a piece of me was missing. After writing 2 programs today, I feel energized. Thinking through the algorithm of the programs was fun, I enjoyed every minute of it. These are just simple program. When I learn to make complex projects, it will be a lot of fun.
